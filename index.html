        Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos
        Eisley or wherever you're going. You must do what you feel is right, of course.

        He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make
        the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.
        A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go
        alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and
        watch over the droids. But he can...
    </p>

    <p>
        Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly
        cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with
        your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't
        everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo.
        He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But
        sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket
        when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the
        Wookiee win.
    </p>

    <p>
        You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.
        I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting
        too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I
        hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. That's your uncle
        talking. Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?
    </p>

    <p>
        The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down
        there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you
        copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your
        blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a
        straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to
        interpret the entire Imperial computer network.

        // We are intentionally using the load event instead of DOMContentLoaded because the DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the document has been completely loaded and parsed. That means it doesnâ€™t *wait for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading* *before it executes*. The load event can be used to detect a fully-loaded page, and that is exactly what we are looking for. Otherwise, the function would start before our CSS and SVG are ready.
